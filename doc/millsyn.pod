millsyn - Mill syntax

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mill has a syntax.

=head2 Variables

A variable is defined using the C<let> keyword, for example:

    let food = "orange"
    let (source, age) = ("orange tree", months(1))

Variables defined with C<let> are immutable unless their names start with C<$>
or C<%>:

    let food = "orange"
    let $age = months(1)
    let %rotten = false
    food = "apple" # error: attempt to assign immutable variable
    $age = $age + years(1) # ok
    %rotten = true # ok

The difference between C<$> and C<%> is that when the name of a variable starts
with C<%>, its value is reset at the end of the scope:

    let ($a, %b) = (1, 2)
    {
        $a = 3
        %b = 4
    }
    p($a) # prints 3
    p(%b) # prints 2

The value is reset even when an exception is thrown before the end of the scope
is reached. Additionally, mutations to C<%> variables are visible only to the
current thread, unlike mutations to C<$> variables.

=head3 Special Variables

There are certain built-in special variables:

=head4 General Special Variables

=over

=item %_

The topic, which is set by various control structures. It is often used as a
default argument for subroutines.

    # proc outln(s: String = %_)
    # proc errln(s: String = %_)

    for list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) {
        p(%_)
    }

    given "Hello, world!" {
        outln()
        errln()
    }

    match list(1, 2) {
        case list(_, _) =>
            assert(count(%_) == 2)

        case _ =>
            assert(count(%_) != 2)
    }

=item $0, $1, $2, …

The arguments of a short lambda:

    let addmul = $($0 + $1 * $2)
    p(addmul(3, 6, 8)) # 51
